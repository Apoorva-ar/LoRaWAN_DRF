Randomization algo ; beacon tx is activated for all gateways with a pre defined probablity 
(common for all gws) in main.py 
It deals with randomizing beacon tx among gateways, network wide-> all gateways involved over time

# usage
set ADR=0 in main.py
set p array
and run 

>DRF Algo

#usage
>set ADR=1 in main.py




To experiment with different number of nodes:
>change in main.py 
1)coordED_20 to coordED_50 or coordED_100
2)change nrNodes 
coordinates of the ED are fixed specified in coordinates.py

Preamble detection
ED opens RX window for 2 symbols:
Airtime for 2 preamble symbols  with foll configuration:
SF=12
BW=125KHz
Airtime = 466.94 ms

1 beacon miss
ED opens window for extra 2 symbols
